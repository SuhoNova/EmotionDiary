# EmotionDiary
This is a simple Xamarin app for MSA Module 2 submission.

This app takes a photo of the user, and then sends it to Cognitive Service's Emotion API from Microsoft. 

The app gets the emotion of the user's face, and sends that data with user's location to an 'easy table'. 

The user can access this data which shows what emotion they were feeling at the specified location.
